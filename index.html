<h2>MY PROFILE </h2>
	<p>I am a last born of four kids and was born in Malindi. I enjoy travelling,singing and reading although reading comes first. The idea of starting something new without knowing how it will end and the mysteries that will unfold as the pages become bulkier is what intrigues me the most about books. I enjoy mostly fictional books because of the imaginary world created in the readers mind.I enjoy traveling because seeing nature just makes one see how insignificant we really are in this endless ecosystem. How mere man cant do a single thing to alter the course nature takes everyday to provide for the endless being in this Universe. Because of this, my favourite colour is <span class="green">green.</span></p><br><h2>Here are the reasons why i love green;</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>It is an enchanting color</li>
		<li>It gives a peaceful feeling from within</li>
		<li>it is the colour of Mother Nature</li>
	</ul>

	<p> Throughout my life i have always enjoyed computers. The programs behind its functioning and the codes such as HTML all make you see life at another level. The idea of starting a program knowing it could fail or could turn out to be the biggest breakthrough for the human race is enthrilling and thats what started this amazing journey for me, the journey to understand <span class="yellow">computers.</span> </p>
